## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is William Agbo.
I am a data-driven professional with 10+ years of analytical expertise transitioning from biomedical science to data analytics. I am particularly interested in AI, machine learning and all things data science. My favourite tools are Python and Tableau. When I am not trying to make sense of some dataset, I am looking for ways to teach young children to study the Bible more effectively.
